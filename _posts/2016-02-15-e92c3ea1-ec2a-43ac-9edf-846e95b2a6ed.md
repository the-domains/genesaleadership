## Thinking Beyond the Box: Catalyzing Leadership Potential

Corporate America has two huge problems:

Baby
boomers are retiring, leaving the _biggest leadership gap in history.                          _Those
who hope to replace them are _unequipped for the job._

Business leaders say that young professionals don't
collaborate, build relationships or take risks. They are ineffective team
members who communicate poorly and do not think strategically.

Development of these leadership behaviors is critical to
solving the complex problems we face today, but the extent to which these
leadership competencies can be mastered is reliant upon the growth of
underlying Intellectual and Emotional Capacities.
