## Thinking Beyond the Box: How Young Catalysts Will Lead the Future of
Business

Corporate America has two huge problems:

* Baby boomers are
retiring, leaving the biggest leadership gap in history.
* The new generation
is unequipped for the job.

Business leaders say that young professionals don't know how to:

* Collaborate
* Build relationships
* Take risks
* Work well in teams
* Communicate effectively
* Think strategically

These leadership behaviors are critical to address the pace of change
and complex problems we face today.

Intellectual and Emotional Capacities are necessary to master these
behaviors, but only 10% of our leaders possess these capacities.
