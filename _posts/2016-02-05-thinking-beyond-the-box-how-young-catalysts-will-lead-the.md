# Thinking Beyond the Box : How Young Catalysts Will Lead the
Future of Business

Corporate America has two huge problems:

Baby
boomers are retiring, leaving the biggest leadership gap in history.    The new
generation is unequipped for the job.

Business leaders say that young professionals don't know how
to:

* collaborate
* build relationships
* take risks
* work well in teams
* communicate effectively
* think strategically

These leadership behaviors are critical to address the pace
of change and complex problems we face today.Critical underlying Intellectual and Emotional Capacities are necessary
to master these behaviors, _but only 10% of our leaders possess these capacities
._
