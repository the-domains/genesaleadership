# Thinking Beyond the Box : How Young Catalysts Will Lead the
Future of Business

Baby
boomers are retiring, leaving the biggest leadership gap in history.    The new
generation is unequipped for the job.

Business leaders say that young professionals don't know how
to:

* collaborate
* build relationships
* take risks
* work well in teams
* communicate effectively
* think strategically

These leadership behaviors are critical to address the pace
of change and complex problems we face today.Critical underlying Intellectual and Emotional Capacities are necessary
to master these behaviors, _but only 10% of our leaders possess these capacities
._
