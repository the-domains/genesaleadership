# Young Catalyst Leaders

__

_What has given you the greatest sense of accomplishment so far? What qualities of character helped you to achieve it? Did failure or overcoming obstacles factor into your success? How did you overcome them and persevere?___

I have a magnet on the fridge that says, "Go into the world
and do well, but more importantly go into the world and do good."

I graduated 6 years ago, and I do really well in everything
I do, I perform. I am doing well but I want to be more focused on doing good. I
changed my mind, and now ask, am I doing well or am I doing good? 

I am talking about doing good in different capacities. I am
not a doctor or a teacher. I struggle with _how_
am I doing good? Now that I have a team, I mentor, develop, and coach. For me
it is more important to help them through trials of life, not trials of the job.

I have one team member who has a problem with drinking.It is important that I show empathy and
humility to him. It has changed how I view the world: Relationships with my
family, friends and husband. Having those relationships is a real
accomplishment for me.

Qualities that are important to me are empathy, humility, and building conditions of
trust. 

_How do you build
conditions of trust?_
