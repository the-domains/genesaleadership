# Adult Stage Development

We know that as people develop - how one views the
world, what one chooses to identify with and how one makes sense of reality - they
transition thru a series of recognizable _stages_. We develop through these stages on a continuum. When we are presented with new ideas we question, test, fall
back into our comfort zone (regress), and test new behaviors again.

Each stage has recognizable
characteristics.

Knowing which stage one is in one can
predict how one thinks, learns and behaves.

Early stages of development are closely
correlated with age. However, once one reaches their 20s this correlation disappears.
