# Adult Stage Development
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/22f44bca119bd6be0034c02bc178f4f6f6bdf029.jpg)

We know that as people develop - how they view the
world, what they choose to identify with and they make sense of reality - they
transition thru a series of recognizable _stages_. Development through these stages is on a continuum. So for example, when one is presented with new ideas, one questions, tests new behaviors, falls back into their comfort zone, and then forward, testing the new behaviors again.

Each stage has recognizable
characteristics.

Knowing which stage one is in one can
predict how one thinks, learns and behaves.

Early stages of development are closely
correlated with age. However, once one reaches their 20s this correlation disappears.
