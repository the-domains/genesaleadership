Genesa Leadership Institute, LLC is a leadership development organization that offers a transformational approach to personal and organizational success.

We now know that leadership develops in predictable stages. As leaders move through these stages, they increase their ability to think creatively, manage change and complexity more effectively; increasing their ability to think more strategically and act with greater intentionality. The Genesa Concept(tm) offers leading edge programs that are evidence-based and proven to facilitate a rare form of leadership capacity and success, making it possible to uncover and cultivate the characteristics of high potential leaders. This model provides us with new "human technology" that acknowledges the importance of emotional intelligence to solve problems, gain greater insight, increase workplace team effectiveness and foster innovation. Using a client's core strengths, it is possible to transform behaviors in a realistic and incremental way, while achieving personal and professional goals.
